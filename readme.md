## Ongoing project: Creating a website for Satwikyoga.com

## 'new' folder is me creating the website from scratch. 
Goals: Fully responsive web-app (Potentially extended to a mobile app as well) using Node.js & React.js

## 'old' folder was me modifying a template from html
Sadly it had conflicts with a slideshow feature I wanted to implement and I had to scrap this for the time being, kept it around because I might reuse some elements from the page.
